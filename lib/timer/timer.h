/**
 * @class Timer
 * @brief A simple timer utility class for managing time-based operations.
 *
 * The Timer class provides functionality to start, reset, and check the status
 * of a timer. It uses the `millis()` function to track elapsed time and determine
 * whether the timer has expired or is still running. Additionally, it provides
 * methods to retrieve the elapsed and remaining time.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * Timer myTimer;
 * myTimer.start(5000); // Start a timer for 5 seconds
 *
 * while (!myTimer.isExpired()) {
 *     // Perform some operations while the timer is running
 *     Serial.println("Timer is running...");
 * }
 *
 * Serial.println("Timer expired!");
 * @endcode
 *
